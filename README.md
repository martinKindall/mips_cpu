# MIPS 32 bits Single Cycle CPU

This project is based on the book [Digital Design and Computer Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Design-Computer-Architecture-Harris/dp/0123944244/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=digital+design+and+computer+architecture&qid=1670106216&sprefix=digital+design%2Caps%2C178&sr=8-1) and its example for a MIPS cpu written in Systemverilog.

The designs are in the folder __sources_1__ and the top module is _MipsTop.sv_.
